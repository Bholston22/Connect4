# Connect4
Created a two-player Connect 4 game using Visual Studio Code. Players take turns dropping colored discs into a grid, aiming to connect four of their discs in a row. The game has an easy-to-use interface and clear visuals, providing a fun and interactive gaming experience. The code is well-organized and includes error handling for smooth gameplay.
